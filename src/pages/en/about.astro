          I'm the Co-founder & CTO of <strong>Jaden Data</strong>, where I've
          played a pivotal role in transforming an idea into a fully profitable
          company with annual revenues exceeding €1M. We architect process
          intelligence—AI-native systems that transform how businesses operate.
          My expertise spans <strong
            >enterprise LLM platforms, RAG systems, and secure cloud
            architectures</strong
          >, but it's always applied through a process-first lens: understanding
          how businesses actually work, then enhancing operations with
          intelligent automation.

        <p class="bio-text">
          I've scaled the engineering team from 0 to 10 developers, building a
          high-performance technical organization. I architect serverless,
          event-driven microservices on AWS with multi-model stacks (OpenAI,
          Azure, Bedrock, Mistral). Led multi-tenant designs handling
          <strong>&gt;1,000 concurrent connections</strong> and
          <strong>thousands of requests per second</strong>. Delivered
          <strong>ISO 27001 and SOC 2</strong> compliance in ~3 months—achieving
          certifications within a tight deadline. But the real focus: translating
          business needs into systems that deliver measurable impact across manufacturing,
          pharmaceutical, venture capital, real estate, and financial services.

        <h2>Outside Work</h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
          I love extreme sports and outdoor activities. I am a certified
          skydiver (PJ(B) license), Advanced Open Water diver, International
          Windsurfing Instructor, and an avid snowboarder. These experiences
          build essential skills: risk management, clear instruction and
          teaching, calm under pressure, and disciplined preparation—all of
          which translate directly to technical leadership, team mentoring, and
          crisis handling in high-stakes enterprise environments.

          I'm multilingual, speaking Polish (native), English (professional),

      <!-- Detailed Bio -->

        <h2>Process Intelligence Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
          I've spent years watching businesses struggle with AI adoption. The
          problem isn't the technology—it's understanding that <strong
            >AI must serve your processes, not replace them</strong
          >. That's why every solution we build at Jaden Data starts with
          understanding how work actually gets done.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          As an AI Architect and CTO, I specialize in <strong
            >enterprise LLM platforms</strong
          >,
          <strong>retrieval-augmented generation</strong>, and <strong
            >secure cloud architectures</strong
          >. I've architected advanced, multi-tenant AI platforms integrating
          AWS Bedrock, AWS SageMaker, Azure ML Studio, OpenAI, and
          Mistral—delivering seamless connectivity and enabling cross-platform
          collaboration. Built event-driven microservices architectures
          leveraging AWS Fargate (ECS, ECR), Lambda, SNS, SQS, and CloudWatch,
          optimized for cost-efficiency and serverless autoscaling.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          I pioneered the development of state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented
          Generation (RAG) services, automating vector database creation from
          client files using Pinecone, pgvector, and Milvus. Designed and
          implemented robust AI process and RAG pipeline testing frameworks
          (Testbed) for quantitative and qualitative assessment. Developed
          "Prompt Wizard," a sophisticated tool that automates LLM prompt
          optimization, significantly enhancing prompt engineering workflows for
          enterprise users.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          But technical capability is just the foundation. The real value comes
          from applying these capabilities to transform operations: turning
          hours of manual work into minutes of automated intelligence, enabling
          faster decision-making, and building systems that adapt and learn with
          your business.

        <h2>Career Journey</h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
          My career has been about translating technical excellence into
          business impact. At <strong>idealo</strong>, I built production-ready
          products from ideation to release, developing real-time
          high-performance solutions based on Kafka, NoSQL, and WebSockets.
          Enabled login in 6 countries, yielding <strong
            >1.4M new accounts in 3 months (700% over forecast)</strong
          >—understanding that technical systems must serve business growth.
          Implemented enterprise microservices in Java and Kotlin with Spring
          Boot, ensuring idealo applications worked flawlessly 24/7 through
          on-call duty.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          At <strong>T-Labs (Deutsche Telekom)</strong>, I developed system
          architecture for blockchain-based package tracking, implementing and
          deploying distributed Hyperledger blockchain networks. Built chaincode
          (smart contracts), secured REST APIs, and proxy microservices enabling
          mobile application and ERP system interaction with
          blockchain—exploring how distributed systems can enable new forms of
          collaboration.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          At <strong>SAS Institute</strong>, I worked with banking sector
          customers implementing the first platform for real-time user action
          evaluation with ML models. The system analyzed payment and behavior
          patterns to serve targeted marketing campaigns, processing thousands
          of events per second using Kafka, Protobuf, and Apache Flink—early
          experience in high-throughput, real-time stream processing for
          financial services.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          Holds dual M.Sc. in Computer Science (TU Berlin, PW Warsaw). Works
          across architecture, security, team management, and delivery to meet
          compliance and KPIs—because enterprise systems must deliver both
          technical excellence and measurable business outcomes.
