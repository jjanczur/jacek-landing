        <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
        <p>
          As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these
          pages according to general law. However, I am not obligated to monitor
          third-party information transmitted or stored, or to investigate
          circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general
          law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only
          possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of
          the law becomes known. Upon becoming aware of such violations, I will
          remove this content immediately.
        </p>

      <div class="imprint-section">
        <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
        <p>
          My website contains links to external websites of third parties, on
          whose contents I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any
          liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
          operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the
          linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
          violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not
          recognizable at the time of linking.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is
          not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law.
          Upon becoming aware of violations, I will remove such links
          immediately.
        </p>
