      "I love extreme sports and outdoor activities. I am a certified skydiver (PJ(B) license), Advanced Open Water diver, International Windsurfing Instructor, and an avid snowboarder. These experiences build essential skills: risk management, clear instruction and teaching, calm under pressure, and disciplined preparation-all of which translate directly to technical leadership, team mentoring, and crisis handling in high-stakes enterprise environments.",

  "philosophy": {
    "title": "Process Intelligence Philosophy",
    "paragraphs": [
      "I've spent years watching businesses struggle with AI adoption. The problem isn't the technology-it's understanding that <strong>AI must serve your processes, not replace them</strong>. That's why every solution we build at Jaden Data starts with understanding how work actually gets done.",
      "As an AI Architect and CTO, I specialize in <strong>enterprise LLM platforms</strong>, <strong>retrieval-augmented generation</strong>, and <strong>secure cloud architectures</strong>. I've architected advanced, multi-tenant AI platforms integrating AWS Bedrock, AWS SageMaker, Azure ML Studio, OpenAI, and Mistral-delivering seamless connectivity and enabling cross-platform collaboration. Built event-driven microservices architectures leveraging AWS Fargate (ECS, ECR), Lambda, SNS, SQS, and CloudWatch, optimized for cost-efficiency and serverless autoscaling.",
      "I pioneered the development of state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) services, automating vector database creation from client files using Pinecone, pgvector, and Milvus. Designed and implemented robust AI process and RAG pipeline testing frameworks (Testbed) for quantitative and qualitative assessment. Developed \"Prompt Wizard,\" a sophisticated tool that automates LLM prompt optimization, significantly enhancing prompt engineering workflows for enterprise users.",
      "But technical capability is just the foundation. The real value comes from applying these capabilities to transform operations: turning hours of manual work into minutes of automated intelligence, enabling faster decision-making, and building systems that adapt and learn with your business."

      "My biggest milestone was building <strong>Jaden Data</strong> from zero to a profitable, bootstrapped company (&#x2265;€1M annual revenue) while scaling engineering from 0 to 10. I lead architecture and delivery for enterprise AI: multi-tenant SaaS, high-throughput distributed systems on AWS, and reliable LLM/RAG pipelines.",
      "<ul><li><strong>Enterprise AI on AWS</strong>: event-driven microservices (Lambda, ECS/Fargate, SNS/SQS), multi-model LLM integrations (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Bedrock, Mistral)</li><li><strong>Security + compliance</strong>: ISO 27001 and SOC 2 delivered under tight timelines</li><li><strong>Practical LLM engineering</strong>: prompt + RAG evaluation tooling so teams can ship safely</li></ul>",
      "Before Jaden Data, I worked as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> at <strong>idealo</strong>, contributing to international login rollout (6 countries) and building real-time systems (Kafka/NoSQL/WebSockets) and enterprise microservices (Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot) with 24/7 on-call responsibility.",
      "Earlier, I built blockchain and distributed systems at <strong>T-Labs (Deutsche Telekom)</strong> and delivered real-time analytics systems for banking at <strong>SAS Institute</strong>. I hold a dual M.Sc. in Computer Science (TU Berlin + Warsaw University of Technology)."
