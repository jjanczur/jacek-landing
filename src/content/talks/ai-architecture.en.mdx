# AI Architecture Patterns: Lessons from Enterprise LLM Deployments

## Abstract

Building production-ready AI systems requires more than just calling APIs. This talk explores the
architectural patterns that enable scalable, secure, and cost-effective LLM deployments in
enterprise environments.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

- Isolation strategies for shared infrastructure
- Resource allocation and quota management
- Cross-tenant security considerations

### 2. Cost Optimization Patterns

- Intelligent model routing based on complexity
- Caching strategies for repeated queries
- Batch processing for cost efficiency

### 3. Observability and Monitoring

- LLM-specific metrics and alerting
- Performance benchmarking across models
- Quality assurance through evaluation pipelines

### 4. Governance and Compliance

- Data lineage and audit trails
- Model version control and rollback strategies
- Regulatory compliance automation

## Real-World Examples

The talk includes case studies from:

- Financial services AI workflows
- Legal document analysis at scale
- Healthcare compliance automation
- Multi-language content processing

## Tools and Technologies

- **Infrastructure**: AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Kubernetes
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, Prefect
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry
- **Security**: Vault, Key Management Services
- **Evaluation**: Custom frameworks with statistical testing

## Q&A Highlights

The session concluded with an engaging Q&A covering topics like:

- Balancing model performance vs. cost
- Implementing effective prompt engineering at scale
- Managing model drift and retraining schedules
- Building robust evaluation frameworks
