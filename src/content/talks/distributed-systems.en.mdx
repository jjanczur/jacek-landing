# Distributed Systems at Scale: Throughput, Latency & Resilience

## Abstract

Modern applications demand both high throughput and low latency, but achieving both requires careful
architectural decisions. This talk explores the trade-offs and patterns for building resilient
distributed systems.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

- Decoupling producers and consumers
- Asynchronous processing patterns
- Event sourcing for auditability

### 2. Back-Pressure Mechanisms

- Queue-based load shedding
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Adaptive concurrency limits

### 3. Observability at Scale

- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Metrics collection strategies
- Alerting and anomaly detection

### 4. Consistency Models

- CAP theorem in practice
- Choosing the right consistency level
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Performance Patterns

- **Read-Heavy Workloads**: CDN and edge caching strategies
- **Write-Heavy Workloads**: Event-driven pipelines and CQRS
- **Mixed Workloads**: Hybrid approaches with intelligent routing

## Failure Modes & Recovery

The talk covers common failure scenarios:

- Network partitions and split-brain
- Cascading failures and circuit breakers
- Data consistency during outages
- Graceful degradation strategies

## Technology Stack Examples

- **Message Brokers**: Apache Kafka, AWS SQS/SNS, Google Pub/Sub
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd, Consul
- **Databases**: CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, Cassandra
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger

## Case Studies

Real examples from:

- E-commerce platforms handling Black Friday traffic
- Financial trading systems with microsecond latency requirements
- IoT platforms processing millions of device events
- Social media feeds serving billions of requests daily

## Best Practices

- **Testing**: Chaos engineering and failure injection
- **Deployment**: Blue-green deployments and canary releases
- **Security**: Zero-trust architecture and service-to-service auth
- **Cost Optimization**: Auto-scaling and resource right-sizing

This technical deep-dive has helped numerous teams redesign their systems for better scalability and
reliability.
